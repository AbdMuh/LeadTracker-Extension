# Lead Tracker Chrome Extension  

A simple Chrome extension that allows users to **save and manage leads** (URLs) directly in their browser. The extension stores the links in **localStorage**, so they persist even after the browser is closed.

## Features  
- **Save URLs manually** by entering them in an input field  
- **Save the current tab's URL** with a single button click  
- **Persist data using localStorage**  
- **Clear all saved leads** with a double-click on the delete button  

## How It Works  
1. Enter a URL in the input field and click **"Save Input"** to store it.  
2. Click **"Save Tab"** to automatically save the URL of the currently active tab.  
3. All saved leads are displayed as **clickable links
